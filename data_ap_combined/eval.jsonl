{"instruction": "Explain chemical equilibrium and Le Chatelier's principle for AP Chemistry.", "input": "", "output": "Chemical equilibrium is a central concept in AP Chemistry that connects thermodynamics, kinetics, and molecular behavior. Let me break this down systematically.\n\n**What is Chemical Equilibrium?**\nA dynamic state where the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, resulting in constant concentrations of reactants and products.\n\n**Key Characteristics:**\n- **Dynamic:** Reactions continue in both directions\n- **Macroscopic:** No observable changes in concentrations\n- **Microscopic:** Continuous molecular collisions and reactions\n\n**Equilibrium Expression:**\nFor reaction: aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD\n\nKeq = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Only includes aqueous and gaseous species\n- Solids and pure liquids have activity = 1\n- Temperature dependent\n- Unitless (activities, not concentrations)\n\n**Le Chatelier's Principle:**\n\"When a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it shifts to counteract the disturbance.\"\n\n**Types of Disturbances:**\n\n**1. Concentration Changes:**\n- **Add reactant/remove product:** Shifts right (forward)\n- **Remove reactant/add product:** Shifts left (reverse)\n- **Example:** N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃\n  - Adding N₂ shifts right to consume excess N₂\n\n**2. Pressure/Volume Changes (gases only):**\n- **Increase pressure (decrease volume):** Shifts toward fewer gas molecules\n- **Decrease pressure (increase volume):** Shifts toward more gas molecules\n- **Example:** N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃ (4 moles → 2 moles)\n  - Increased pressure shifts right\n\n**3. Temperature Changes:**\n- **Exothermic reaction (ΔH < 0):**\n  - Increase T: Shifts left (endothermic direction)\n  - Decrease T: Shifts right (exothermic direction)\n- **Endothermic reaction (ΔH > 0):**\n  - Increase T: Shifts right (endothermic direction)\n  - Decrease T: Shifts left (exothermic direction)\n\n**4. Catalysts:**\n- **No effect on equilibrium position**\n- Increases both forward and reverse rates equally\n- Reaches equilibrium faster\n\n**AP Problem-Solving Strategy:**\n\n**ICE Tables (Initial, Change, Equilibrium):**\n```\n        N₂  +  3H₂  ⇌  2NH₃\nI:      0.5    1.5      0\nC:      -x     -3x     +2x\nE:    0.5-x   1.5-3x    2x\n```\n\n**Example AP Problem:**\nAt 500°C, Keq = 0.040 for N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃\nInitial: [N₂] = 0.50 M, [H₂] = 1.5 M, [NH₃] = 0 M\nFind equilibrium concentrations.\n\n**Solution:**\nKeq = [NH₃]² / ([N₂][H₂]³) = 0.040\n\n0.040 = (2x)² / ((0.5-x)(1.5-3x)³)\n\nThis requires approximation or numerical methods typical in AP problems.\n\n**Connection to Thermodynamics:**\n- ΔG° = -RT ln Keq\n- Keq > 1: Products favored (ΔG° < 0)\n- Keq < 1: Reactants favored (ΔG° > 0)\n\n**Common AP Applications:**\n- Acid-base equilibria (Ka, Kb)\n- Solubility equilibria (Ksp)\n- Complex ion formation (Kf)\n- Gas phase reactions\n\nUnderstanding equilibrium is crucial for predicting reaction behavior and optimizing industrial processes!", "id": "ap_tutor_005", "source": "ap_curriculum_data", "quality": "high", "level": "AP", "type": "tutoring"}
