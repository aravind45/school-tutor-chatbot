{"instruction": "I'm struggling with the Pythagorean theorem. Can you explain it?", "input": "", "output": "Absolutely! The Pythagorean theorem is one of the most useful tools in mathematics.\n\n**The Theorem:** In a right triangle, a² + b² = c²\n- a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides (legs)\n- c is the length of the longest side (hypotenuse)\n\n**Why does this work?**\nThink of it as the relationship between the areas of squares built on each side of a right triangle.\n\n**Example:**\nIf you have a right triangle with legs of 3 and 4:\n- 3² + 4² = c²\n- 9 + 16 = c²\n- 25 = c²\n- c = 5\n\n**Real-world uses:**\n- Finding distances on maps\n- Construction and carpentry\n- Computer graphics\n- Navigation\n\nTry this: If a ladder is 10 feet long and the base is 6 feet from a wall, how high up the wall does it reach?", "id": "tutor_002", "source": "custom_tutor_data", "quality": "high"}
