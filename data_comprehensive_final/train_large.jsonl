We made a right triangle!\"\n\nMaya learned something important: when you combine movements in different directions, you can't just add the numbers. You have to consider BOTH the distance AND the direction.\n\nThe treasure was buried exactly where the math predicted - 50 steps from the oak tree, at an angle pointing northeast.\n\n**The Lesson:** Vector addition isn't regular addition. When directions change, you need special math to find the true result. That's what makes vectors so powerful - they keep track of both \"how much\" and \"which way\"!\n\n**Your Turn:** Next time you walk around your neighborhood, try this: walk one block east, then one block north.
