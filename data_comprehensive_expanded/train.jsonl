It has very few molecules, so even though they're moving super fast (high temperature), there's not much total energy.\n\n**Result:** The spark doesn't burn you because it can't transfer much heat energy to your body.\n\n**The Lake (Low Temperature, Lots of Heat):**\nLater, you jump in the nearby lake.
